# FRAUD-DETECTION-ON-BANK-PAYMENTS

**INTRODUCTION:**
Fraudulent behavior can be seen across many different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, payment and banking systems. Fraud is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. Fraud detection in financial transactions has become an essential priority for banks.Even if fraud seems to be scary for businesses it can be detected using intelligent systems such as rules engines or machine learning
 common Two rule methods:
1.deny transactions from known fraudsters
2.limiting transactions

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Higher accuracy of fraud detection. As opposed to rule-based solutions,
machine learning mechanisms have higher precision and return relevant results
as they study multiple additional factors.
- low manual work is needed for additional verification. Improved accuracy leads to a decrease in the burden on analysts. As people are unable to
check every transaction, even for a small bank
- Fewer false declines. False declines happen when a system recognizes a legal
transaction as suspicious and wrongfully cancels it.
- Ability to identify new patterns and adapt to changes. Unlike rulebased systems, ML aligns with the constant evolution of the environment;
They enable analysts to remember new suspicious ways(pattern) and create
new rules to prevent new types of scams.

**DATASET:**
synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts.3lakh good,20k fraud.

**Comparing Accuracies of the four Models**
- Logistic Regression 91.38
- K-Nearest Neighbor 92.66
- Decision Tree Classification  96.11
- Random Forest Algorithm 96.64

**ADVANTAGES:**
-finding hidden and implicit correlations in the data
- automatic detection of possible fraud scenarios
- reduced number of verification measures
- real-time processing

**FUTURE SCOPE:**
The findings obtained here are not in a generalized form that can be directly used
in the global fraud detection problem. Here, we have considered a sample data set.
As future work, some effective algorithms could be developed for the classification
problem with variable misclassification costs.
And the collection of more payment data will improve the modelâ€™s accuracy
